| Ultra-Strong  | 20+ chars   | Yes       | Yes       | Yes     | Yes     | Random       |

## Estimated Crack Times

| Password Type         | Length   | Estimated Crack Time  |
|------------------------|----------|------------------------|
| Dictionary word        | 8 chars  | < 1 second             |
| Dictionary + number    | 9 chars  | < 1 hour               |
| Mixed case + symbols   | 8 chars  | 2–3 days               |
| Random characters      | 10 chars | 3–4 years              |
| Random characters      | 12 chars | 34,000 years           |
| Random characters      | 14 chars | 200 million years      |
| Strong passphrase      | 20 chars | 2 billion years        |

## Key Insights

- **Length and randomness are critical** for secure passwords.
- **Common words** or simple patterns can be cracked in **seconds**.
- Aim for **12+ character** random strings or **long passphrases** for serious protection.
- Use a password manager to safely generate and store complex passwords.
